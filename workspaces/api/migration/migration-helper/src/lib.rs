//! This module aims to make it as easy as possible to migrate a data store between minor
//! versions.  Migration authors just implement one trait, and can then use helper methods to take
//! care of everything else in their main function.
//!
//! Note that you must still name your migration binary according to spec for it to be handled
//! properly by the migration runner.

// Note that migrations must be run serially; technically, this is because the data store isn't
// locked, and also because migration authors are given an interface for ordering via migration
// name, and running in parallel would violate that.
