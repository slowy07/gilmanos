//! The apiclient library provides simple, synchronous methods to query an HTTP API over a
//! Unix-domain socket.
//!
//! The `raw_request` method takes care of the basics of making an HTTP request on a Unix-domain
//! socket, and requires you to specify the socket path, the URI (including query string), the
//! HTTP method, and any request body data.
//!
//! In the future, we intend to add methods that understand the Thar API and help more with common
//! types of requests.

// Think "reqwest" but for Unix-domain sockets.  Would be nice to use the simpler reqwest instead
// of hyper, but it lacks Unix-domain socket support:
// https://github.com/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/39
